This is one of my apps for the TidByt. You can pull images from an endpoint that serves images or JSON. Things like random image endpoints are an ideal use.

This repo is intended as a testing and staging area before things get pushed to https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/apiimage.

API calls based on https://plexapi.dev/api-reference/server/get-server-capabilities documentation.

Example usages:

-----

Required fields:

```Plex server URL``` and ```Plex token```
